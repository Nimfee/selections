        <p>Serbian (Serbian Cyrillic: српски, Gaj's Latin: srpski, pronounced [sr̩̂pskiː]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language[9][10][11] used chiefly by Serbs in Serbia, Montenegro,[12] and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, it is a recognized minority language in Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.

            Standard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on Šumadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovinian dialects[13]), which is also the basis of Standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. [14] The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian.

            Serbian is practically the only European standard language with complete synchronic digraphia,[15] using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets; speakers read the two scripts equally[citation needed] well. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić, who created the alphabet on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet was designed by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1830.</p>
